# NEXUS: The Unified Developer Control Plane

Nexus is a premium full-stack dashboard designed to aggregate fragmented developer data into a single, high-performance command center.

## 🚀 Vision
The goal of Nexus is to provide a "single pane of glass" for engineering teams, combining system health monitoring, incident activity feeds, and knowledge management with a state-of-the-art cyber-glassmorphic aesthetic.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Framer Motion (Animations) + Lucide (Icons)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (Modular API)
- **Design**: Vanilla CSS with HSL-based design system and glassmorphism.

## 📂 Project Structure

## ⚡ Quick Start
1. Navigate to the `projects/Rux` directory.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start both the frontend and backend servers.
3. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ✨ Core Features (Initial Version)
- **System Intelligence**: Real-time mock health monitoring and latency tracking.
