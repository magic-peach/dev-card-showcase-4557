### 🍉 Overview
This Pull Request introduces **Fruit-Slicer-Game**, a highly interactive, physics-based arcade swipe game. Inspired by mobile classics, this web-based adaptation challenges players to slice entities (fruits) while avoiding hazards (bombs) using fluid mouse or touch drag events. 

Built entirely within a single-file architecture for zero-latency loading and maximum portability, this project demonstrates advanced event tracking, kinematic projectile physics, and real-time bounding box intersection logic.

Closes #0000

### ✨ Core Technical Implementations

#### 1. Kinematic Projectile Physics Engine
* **Gravity Simulation:** Implements a continuous game loop via `requestAnimationFrame` that applies a constant downward gravitational vector to all spawned entities.
* **Parabolic Arcs:** Entities are spawned with randomized initial vertical velocities and slight horizontal drift, resulting in natural, unpredictable parabolic arcs across the viewport.
* **Garbage Collection:** Entities that fall below the bottom threshold of the canvas/DOM are actively purged from the state array to prevent memory leaks and ensure stable 60 FPS performance.

#### 2. Swipe Trajectory Tracking
* **Multi-Point Event Listeners:** Attaches comprehensive event listeners (`mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`, `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend`) to track the exact coordinates of the user's input.
* **Vector Line Rendering:** Captures the delta between the previous and current frame's input coordinates to draw a trailing "blade" effect that fades over a few frames.

#### 3. Real-Time Collision Detection
* **Line-to-AABB Math:** The slicing mechanic requires a complex intersection algorithm. Instead of checking if a point is inside a box, the game calculates if the mathematical *line segment* (the user's swipe across two frames) intersects with the *Axis-Aligned Bounding Box* (AABB) of the moving entities.
* **State Resolution:** Upon successful intersection, the entity's state immediately updates to "sliced," triggering particle explosions and updating the global score multiplier.

### 🚀 Performance Optimizations
* **Single-File Portability:** All CSS styling, HTML structure, and JavaScript logic are consolidated into `index.html` to eliminate blocking network requests for external assets.
* **Canvas Batching:** Rendering operations are batched using `ctx.save()` and `ctx.restore()` to minimize the performance overhead of continuous context switching.

### 🕹️ How to Test
1. Launch `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click/Tap and hold, then rapidly drag across the screen to generate a slicing blade.
3. Slice the targets as they arc upwards from the bottom of the screen.
4. Avoid slicing any red bombs, or the game ends immediately!
