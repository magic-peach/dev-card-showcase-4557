  "description": "A casual physics puzzle game. Click and drag backward on the puck to aim, then release to slingshot it across a frictionless surface. Bounce off walls, avoid black holes, and hit the glowing target!",
  "long_description": "Sling-Puck computes a drag vector from mousedown origin to current cursor position, normalises it, and inverts it to produce an initial velocity. A dashed trajectory preview is drawn in real-time using repeated Euler-step simulation. Once launched, the puck bounces with elastic wall collisions (velocity component reversal) and is gravitationally attracted to black holes via inverse-square force accumulation. Hitting the target wins the level; falling into a black hole resets. Three difficulty tiers adjust black-hole count and target size.",
